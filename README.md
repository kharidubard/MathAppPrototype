# MathAppPrototype
Khari DuBard 

Descricption
The application allows users to select the type of math operation they want to practice, including addition, subtraction and multiplication. The app generates a series of math problems based on the user's preferences and displays them on the screen. My specific contributions to the Math Practice App include designing and implementing the user interface using React Native and implementing the logic for generating math problems and evaluating user answers. I also contributed to testing and debugging the application to ensure its functionality and usability.
